  <div class="post-content">
    <p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve
been turning over in my mind ever since<!--more-->.</p>

<p>“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember that all
the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”</p>

<p>He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a
reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In
consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up
many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran
bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality
when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was
unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs
of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have
feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some
unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for
the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they
express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.
Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of
missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I
snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out
unequally at birth.</p>

<p>And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it
has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but
after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from
the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a
sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with
privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his
name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented
everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken
series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some
heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of
those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This
responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is
dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary
gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other
person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out
all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the
wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive
sorrows and short-winded elations of men.</p>
