  <div class="post-content">
    <p>We were in class when the head-master came in, followed by a “new fellow,” not
wearing the school uniform, and a school servant carrying a large desk. Those
who had been asleep woke up, and<!--more--> every one rose as if just surprised at his
work.</p>

<p>The head-master made a sign to us to sit down. Then, turning to the
class-master, he said to him in a low voice—</p>

<p>“Monsieur Roger, here is a pupil whom I recommend to your care; he’ll be in the
second. If his work and conduct are satisfactory, he will go into one of the
upper classes, as becomes his age.”</p>

<p>The “new fellow,” standing in the corner behind the door so that he could hardly
be seen, was a country lad of about fifteen, and taller than any of us. His hair
was cut square on his forehead like a village chorister’s; he looked reliable,
but very ill at ease. Although he was not broad-shouldered, his short school
jacket of green cloth with black buttons must have been tight about the
arm-holes, and showed at the opening of the cuffs red wrists accustomed to being
bare. His legs, in blue stockings, looked out from beneath yellow trousers,
drawn tight by braces, He wore stout, ill-cleaned, hob-nailed boots.</p>

<p>We began repeating the lesson. He listened with all his ears, as attentive as if
at a sermon, not daring even to cross his legs or lean on his elbow; and when at
two o’clock the bell rang, the master was obliged to tell him to fall into line
with the rest of us.</p>

<p>When we came back to work, we were in the habit of throwing our caps on the
ground so as to have our hands more free; we used from the door to toss them
under the form, so that they hit against the wall and made a lot of dust: it was
“the thing.”</p>

<p>But, whether he had not noticed the trick, or did not dare to attempt it, the
“new fellow,” was still holding his cap on his knees even after prayers were
over. It was one of those head-gears of composite order, in which we can find
traces of the bearskin, shako, billycock hat, sealskin cap, and cotton night-cap;
one of those poor things, in fine, whose dumb ugliness has depths of expression,
like an imbecile’s face. Oval, stiffened with whalebone, it began with three
round knobs; then came in succession lozenges of velvet and rabbit-skin
separated by a red band; after that a sort of bag that ended in a cardboard
polygon covered with complicated braiding, from which hung, at the end of a long
thin cord, small twisted gold threads in the manner of a tassel. The cap was
new; its peak shone.</p>

<p>“Rise,” said the master.</p>
