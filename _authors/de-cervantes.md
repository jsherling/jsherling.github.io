Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra is a Spanish writer widely regarded as the greatest
writer in the Spanish language<!--more--> and one of the world's pre-eminent novelists.
He has just published *Don Quixote*, a novel we have been told that will have a 
sequel. It's getting rave reviews so far, with one critic saying it is one of
the pinnacles of world literature.
