  <p>
    Our guest authors are established and new, old and young, male and female, and
    any number of additional combinations and contradictions. What they all have
    in common, however, is a good literary experience to share. This list includes
    every guest author we've had so far, and each name links to more details.

    {% for author in site.authors %}

      <p>{{ author.excerpt }}</p>

<section class="staff">
  <h2 class="mb-dot5em">Staff</h2>
  <p>
    While the Timeless Classics staff has undergone multiple changes throughout
    its history, we feel fortunate to be working with this current group of
    accomplished individuals.
