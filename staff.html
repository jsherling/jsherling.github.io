  <h1 class="mb-dot5em center">{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <p>
    Our guest authors are established and new, old and young, male and female, and
    any number of additional combinations and contradictions. What they all have
    in common, however, is a good literary experience to share. This list includes
    every guest author we've had so far, and each name links to more details.

  <ul>
    {% for author in site.authors %}
    <li class="author">
      <h2><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ author.url }}">{{ author.name }}</a></h2>
      <p class="excerpt">
        <br>
        {{ author.excerpt | remove: '<p>' | remove: '</p>' }}

<section class="staff">
  <h2 class="mb-dot5em">Staff</h2>
  <p>
    While the Timeless Classics staff has undergone multiple changes throughout
    its history, we feel fortunate to be working with this current group of
    accomplished individuals.

  <ul>
    {% for author in site.staff %}
    <li class="bullet">
      <h4><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ author.url }}">{{ author.name }}</a></h4>
      <p class="excerpt">
        {{ author.excerpt | remove: '<p>' | remove: '</p>' }}
      </p>
    </li>
