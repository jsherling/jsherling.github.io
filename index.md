We are thrilled to be able to offer excerpts from the latest efforts of authors
hailing from all over the world &mdash; and time. We count ourselves lucky to
sponsor works of such spectacular insight, wit, wisdom, and foresight.  

Every one of these offerings hold great promise, bordering on or exceeding the
minimal expectations of greatness. Who can forget the opening to Herman
Melville's Moby Dick? Or the tension present in the first sentences of Bram
Stoker's Dracula?

Each post is from a just-released work, be it novel, poem, screenplay, or essay.
Some works have been years, even decades, in the making, so we feel honored to
be entrusted with presenting each one on this blog for your enjoyment.  

So make yourself a warm &mdash; or cool &mdash; beverage, retire to your
favorite spot, then kick back and enjoy!
