    <p>Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station
will be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my life with the
beginning of my life, I record that I was born<!--more--> (as I have been informed and
believe) on a Friday, at twelve o’clock at night. It was remarked that the clock
began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously.</p>

<p>In consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by the nurse,
and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest in
me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming personally
acquainted, first, that I was destined to be unlucky in life; and secondly, that
I was privileged to see ghosts and spirits; both these gifts inevitably
attaching, as they believed, to all unlucky infants of either gender, born
towards the small hours on a Friday night.</p>

<p>I need say nothing here, on the first head, because nothing can show better than
my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified by the result. On
the second branch of the question, I will only remark, that unless I ran through
that part of my inheritance while I was still a baby, I have not come into it
yet. But I do not at all complain of having been kept out of this property; and
if anybody else should be in the present enjoyment of it, he is heartily welcome
to keep it.</p>

<p>I was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the newspapers, at the
low price of fifteen guineas. Whether sea-going people were short of money about
that time, or were short of faith and preferred cork jackets, I don’t know; all
I know is, that there was but one solitary bidding, and that was from an
attorney connected with the bill-broking business, who offered two pounds in
cash, and the balance in sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on
any higher bargain. Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead
loss—for as to sherry, my poor dear mother’s own sherry was in the market
then—and ten years afterwards, the caul was put up in a raffle down in our part
of the country, to fifty members at half-a-crown a head, the winner to spend
five shillings. I was present myself, and I remember to have felt quite
uncomfortable and confused, at a part of myself being disposed of in that way.
The caul was won, I recollect, by an old lady with a hand-basket, who, very
reluctantly, produced from it the stipulated five shillings, all in halfpence,
and twopence halfpenny short—as it took an immense time and a great waste of
arithmetic, to endeavour without any effect to prove to her. It is a fact which
will be long remembered as remarkable down there, that she was never drowned,
but died triumphantly in bed, at ninety-two. I have understood that it was, to
the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the water in her life,
except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which she was extremely partial)
she, to the last, expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and
others, who had the presumption to go ‘meandering’ about the world. It was in
vain to represent to her that some conveniences, tea perhaps included, resulted
from this objectionable practice. She always returned, with greater emphasis and
with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection, ‘Let us have no
meandering.’</p>

<p>Not to meander myself, at present, I will go back to my birth.</p>
