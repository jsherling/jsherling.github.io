I"›<p>On an evening in the latter part of May a middle-aged man was walking homeward
from Shaston to the village of Marlott, in the adjoining Vale of Blakemore, or
Blackmoor. The pair of legs that carried him<!--more--> were rickety, and there was a bias
in his gait which inclined him somewhat to the left of a straight line. He
occasionally gave a smart nod, as if in confirmation of some opinion, though he
was not thinking of anything in particular. An empty egg-basket was slung upon
his arm, the nap of his hat was ruffled, a patch being quite worn away at its
brim where his thumb came in taking it off. Presently he was met by an elderly
parson astride on a grey mare, who, as he rode, hummed a wandering tune.</p>

<p>â€œGood night tâ€™ee,â€ said the man with the basket.</p>

<p>â€œGood night, Sir John,â€ said the parson.</p>

<p>The pedestrian, after another pace or two, halted, and turned round.</p>

<p>â€œNow, sir, begging your pardon; we met last market-day on this road about this
time, and I said â€˜Good night,â€™ and you made reply â€˜Good night, Sir John,â€™ as
now.â€</p>

<p>â€œI did,â€ said the parson.</p>

<p>â€œAnd once before thatâ€”near a month ago.â€</p>

<p>â€œI may have.â€</p>

<p>â€œThen what might your meaning be in calling me â€˜Sir Johnâ€™ these different times,
when I be plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler?â€</p>

<p>The parson rode a step or two nearer.</p>

<p>â€œIt was only my whim,â€ he said; and, after a momentâ€™s hesitation: â€œIt was on
account of a discovery I made some little time ago, whilst I was hunting up
pedigrees for the new county history. I am Parson Tringham, the antiquary, of
Stagfoot Lane. Donâ€™t you really know, Durbeyfield, that you are the lineal
representative of the ancient and knightly family of the dâ€™Urbervilles, who
derive their descent from Sir Pagan dâ€™Urberville, that renowned knight who came
from Normandy with William the Conqueror, as appears by Battle Abbey Roll?â€</p>

<p>â€œNever heard it before, sir!â€</p>

<p>â€œWell itâ€™s true. Throw up your chin a moment, so that I may catch the profile of
your face better. Yes, thatâ€™s the dâ€™Urberville nose and chinâ€”a little debased.
Your ancestor was one of the twelve knights who assisted the Lord of
Estremavilla in Normandy in his conquest of Glamorganshire. Branches of your
family held manors over all this part of England; their names appear in the Pipe
Rolls in the time of King Stephen. In the reign of King John one of them was
rich enough to give a manor to the Knights Hospitallers; and in Edward the
Secondâ€™s time your forefather Brian was summoned to Westminster to attend the
great Council there. You declined a little in Oliver Cromwellâ€™s time, but to no
serious extent, and in Charles the Secondâ€™s reign you were made Knights of the
Royal Oak for your loyalty. Aye, there have been generations of Sir Johns among
you, and if knighthood were hereditary, like a baronetcy, as it practically was
in old times, when men were knighted from father to son, you would be Sir John</p>

<p>â€œYe donâ€™t say so!â€</p>

<p>â€œIn short,â€ concluded the parson, decisively smacking his leg with his switch,
â€œthereâ€™s hardly such another family in England.â€</p>
