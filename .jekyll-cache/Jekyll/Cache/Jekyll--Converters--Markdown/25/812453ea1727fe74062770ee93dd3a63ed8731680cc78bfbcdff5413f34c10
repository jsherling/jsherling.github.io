I"≠<p><strong>4.16 Escape special characters</strong></p>

<p>Some characters have special meanings in the Markdown syntax. If you want these
characters verbatim, you have to escape them. For<!--more--> example, a pair of underscores
surrounding text usually makes the text italic. You need to escape the
underscores if you want verbatim underscores instead of italic text. The way to
escape a special character is to add a backslash before it, e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I do not want
\_italic text\_ here</code>. Similarly, if # does not indicate a section heading, you
may write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\# This is not a heading</code>.</p>

<p>As mentioned in Section 4.12, a sequence of whitespaces will be rendered as a
single regular space. If you want to render the sequence of spaces literally,
you need to escape each of them, e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keep the social \ \ \ distance</code>. When a
space is escaped, it is converted to a ‚Äúnon-breaking space,‚Äù which means the
line will not be wrapped at this space, e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mr.\ Dervieux</code>.</p>
